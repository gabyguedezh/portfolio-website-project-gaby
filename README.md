##### Notes on mockup

[Inspiration 1](https://blog.quiet.ly/community/how-to-create-a-writing-portfolio-for-freelancers/)

Have a look at the mockup [HERE](/pre-production-information/project-1.pdf)

### Features
As per the projects brief:</br>
✓ Create a website of around 4-5 pages</br>
✓ Incorporate main navigation and grid layout (you might want to use Flexbox or Bootstrap to accomplish this).</br>
✓ Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5.</br>
✓ Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. 
✓ We advise that you write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development.</br>
✓ The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code.
</br>


### Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Google Fonts
- Font Awesome
- Bootstrap 3.3.7
</br>

### Testing

Manual testing included frequent use of the Developer Tools to adjust style to different screens.</br>
Manual clicking and confirmation that the links work as expected.</br>

### Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
